title: "How To Use This Course"
---

This course has two kinds of lessons: theoretical, with some quizes in the end and practical - where you have to build some app locally and then push it to github so it would be automatically tested.

Each theoretical lesson has a video and text transcript. The information in both is identical - use the type that is easier to understand for you.

Practical lessons also have video and transcript. In practical lessons we are going to build some small projects. After each practical lesson you'll have to create a pull request with your project in this course github repo. Make sure you have [Github](https://github.com/) account.
